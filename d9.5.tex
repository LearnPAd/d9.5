\chapter{E-Learning and Knowledge Management of processes in Public Administration}
\label{ch:intro}

\section{Why \learnpad?}
In modern society public administrations (PAs) are undergoing a transformation
of their perceived role from controllers to proactive service providers, and are
under pressure to constantly improve their service quality while coping with
quickly changing context (changes in law and regulations, societal
globalization, fast technology evolution) and decreasing budgets.  Civil
servants are challenged to understand and put in action latest procedures and
rules within tight time constraints.

\section{What is \learnpad?}
\learnpad is an innovative holistic e-learning platform for PAs that enables
process-driven learning and fosters cooperation and knowledge-sharing.
\learnpad technical innovation is based on four pillars:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a new concept of model-based e-learning (both process and knowledge)
		\begin{quote}
			Learning of processes by Civil Servants is driven by a very
			structured information: models
		\end{quote}
	\item open and collaborative e-learning content management
		\begin{quote}
			Learning should be based on open data and everybody can participate
			to improve these data
		\end{quote}
	\item automatic, learner-specific and collaborative content quality assessment
		\begin{quote}
			Every new content is verified by automatic systems and also by other
			Civil Servants, collaboratively
		\end{quote}
	\item automatic model-driven simulation-based learning and testing
		\begin{quote}
			Civil Servants can run a process in a risk-free simulation in order
			to learn and be evaluated on their new knowledge
		\end{quote}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Who will benefit \learnpad?}
\learnpad is designed with and for the Public Administration.  Civil Servants
from these Public Administrations implements processes everyday: they must be
aware of any evolution or any new process.

\section{When will \learnpad exist?}
\learnpad is a European Union funded project and started on
\origdate\printdate{01/02/2014}.  It's a two and half years long project so it
will end on \printdate{31/08/2016}.  In the meantime, a first prototype has been
evaluated by Regione Marche Administration (Italy) on \printdate{10/11/2015}.  A
second release of the platform will be release on \printdate{15/04/2016}.

\section{What is in this white paper?}
This white paper will present the technical solutions that have been merged
together to meet the requirements of this \learnpad platform.  In the next
section, you'll meet with the \learnpad platform.  In the last section, you'll
meet the partners that participate in the elaboration of this \learnpad
platform.

\chapter{Learn PAd platform: solutions and technologies}
\label{ch:platform}
This section will present the \learnpad platform through two different points of
view: a logical view and a technical view.  The logical view present the usage
of the platform in a typical scenario (see Section~\ref{sec:flow-view}).  The
technical view present the components of the  platform and how they connect to
each other.

\section{Logical view}
\label{sec:flow-view}
The Figure~\ref{fig:flow-view} show the global workflow happening inside the
\learnpad platform.  The Modeling Environment component
\includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/1.png} is the place where
the models are designed.  Then they are verified by the Model Verification
component \includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/2.png} before
being transformed by the Transformations component
\includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/3.png} in different kinds
of representations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Wiki pages for the Collaborative Workspace component
		\includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/4.png}
	\item Ontologies for the Ontology Recommender component
		\includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/5.png}
	\item Business Process files for the Simulation Environment component
		\includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/6.png}
\end{itemize}
Eventually, Collaborative Workspace is checking the content co-created by Civil
Servants by sending them to the Content Analysis component
\includegraphics[height=1.5ex,keepaspectratio]{figures/7.png}.

In the following section, you'll find a more detailed description of all the
components.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\paperwidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/logical-view.png}
	\caption{Flow view of the \learnpad platform}
	\label{fig:flow-view}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Modeling Environment}
\label{sec:modeling-environment}

\paragraph{Technology}
Adoxx, MagicDraw

\paragraph{Description}
In the Modeling Environment component, the Modeler is describing and documenting
the models.  Any modeling tool could be plugged on the \learnpad platform as
long as its providing the correct output format.

The output format contains a few things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A set of models which are woven together\footnote{Business Process
		Models, Case Management Models and Notations, Document and Knowledge
		Models, Organization Models, Competency Models, Business Motivation
		Models, KPI Models}
	\item Clickable images of the models (images and maps of clickable areas)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Verification}
\label{sec:model-verification}

\paragraph{Technology}
PetriNET

\paragraph{Description}
Before importing the models, the \learnpad platform will run a list of
verifications on the models.  These are formal verifications to avoid
importation of models that are not executable or that contains activities that
are not reachable (these are only 2 examples).

\subsection{Transformations}
\label{sec:transformations}

\paragraph{Technology}
EMF, ATL, Acceleo, XSL-T

\paragraph{Description}
Once the model has been validated, it can be imported into the \learnpad
platform.  3 components will need these models for different purposes.

First of all, the Collaborative Workspace component will display these models
into a wiki for the Civil Servants.  These transformations are done using
Modeling Transformations tools like EMF (to represent models), ATL (to convert
models) and Acceleo (to serialize EMF representations of models).

On the second hand, the Ontology Recommender component has to build an ontology
of the models in order to propose recommendations.  The transformations
technology used here is XML-specific: XSL-Transformations.

Finally, the Simulation Environment component will simulate Business Process.
It's using the Activiti Engine which is able to run simulation on Business
Process serialized as BPMN standard format.

\subsection{Collaborative Workspace}
\label{sec:collaborative-workspace}

\paragraph{Technology}
Wiki

\paragraph{Description}
The Collaborative Workspace component is the User Interface entry point for
Civil Servants.  It's in the Collaborative Workspace component they will
consult, browse, learn about new or existing processes.

Civil Servants are able to collaborate into this workspace by providing
additionnal documentation, help to fix inconsistent, incomplete or wrong models

\subsection{Ontology Recommender}
\label{sec:ontology-recommender}

\paragraph{Technology}
ArchiMate, ArchiMEO, RDF

\paragraph{Description}
The Ontology Recommender component will create an ontology based on the models
that are pushed to him.  This ontology will produce different kind of
recommendations to the Civil Servant as they browse the wiki and use the
simulation (see Section~\ref{sec:simulator}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Experts} they could talk to to get more details on the activity
	\item \emph{Similar Cases} which are similar processes to the one currently
		consulted or simulated
	\item \emph{Learning Materials} which are related
		multimedias that can help to understand the activity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation Environment}
\label{sec:simulator}

\paragraph{Technology}
Activiti, BPMN

\paragraph{Description}
On the Simulation Environment component, Civil Servants will be able to
interactively simulate a process, playing each activity and validate each step.
It's a learning tool so the Simulation Environment component will give feedback
about the expected values.  Multiple Civil Servants may interact on a common
simulation too.  In any case, gamification mechanisms will keep this exercise
motivating for Civil Servants.

\subsection{Content Analysis}
\label{sec:content-analysis}

\paragraph{Technology}
Gate

\paragraph{Description}
In the Collaborative Workspace component, the Civil Servants will be able to
co-edit new documents that will improve the processes' documentation.  These
documents will be beneficial for every other Civil Servant.  Therefore, Content
Analysis component is in charge of keeping a minimum level of quality for these
documents.  It will run semantic analysis on the produced documents in order to
spot vagueness or incomplete information in the contents.

\section{Component view}
\label{sec:component-view}
The component view will show which are the real existing components and how they
are connected to each other into the \learnpad platform (see
Figure~\ref{fig:component-view}).

\begin{figure}[!htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\paperwidth,keepaspectratio]{figures/component-view.png}
	\caption{Component view of the \learnpad platform}
	\label{fig:component-view}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Learn PAd Core}
\learnpad platform has been designed as modular as possible.  Everything is
plugged onto this \learnpad Core component.  In order to be independent as much
as possible from the technologies used in each component, each component is
communicating with the \learnpad Core component with REST APIs.

This component is developed inside the XWiki software.  This means that storage
is shared with all components that are part of XWiki.  However, it communicates
with all the components with REST which make it a replaceable component.

\subsection{Modeling Environment}
Modeling Environment component is a specific component.  It's used for modeling
but once used, it can be shutdown.  However, the \learnpad Core component is
assumed to be always online.  Therefore, communication between these two
components are always a one way communication: the Modeling Environment
component send or ask information to the \learnpad Core component.

The format Modeling Environment component is pushing toward the \learnpad
platform is a ZIP archive (files \verb+*.lpzip+) which contains:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Set of models [format:XML/Adoxx or XML/MagicDraw]
	\item Images [format: BMP, JPG, PNG, SVG]
	\item Images map [format:HTML-Map]
	\item Business Process models [format:BPMN 2.0]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaborative Workspace}
The Collaborative Workspace is divided into 2 main components.  Since the
\learnpad Core component is not doing any transformation on the files (\learnpad
Core component is more like a router), the Collaborative Workspace component is
getting raw files.  Therefore, the Wiki component is downloading the raw files
from the \learnpad Core component, then use an EMF Transformation component to
transform models into wiki pages.

\subsubsection{Wiki}
The Wiki component is the most important part of the Collaborative Workspace
component.  It's the Graphical User Interface for Civil Servants where models
will be displayed.  It contains modeling data, stored with a generic format, and
an application capable of displaying these datas.

Wiki component will get models, ask for transformation, and import the resulting
wiki pages from the transformation.

\subsubsection{EMF Transformation}
This transformation module is using EMF technologies to operate transformations
on models.  Each meta-model (Adoxx, MagicDraw, XWiki) is represented as an Ecore
module.  Then, a transformation language, ATL, transform them from an Ecore A
(Adoxx or MagicDraw) to an Ecore B (XWiki).  Finally, Acceleo is serializing the
Ecore to wiki pages which are sent to the Wiki component.

\subsection{Ontology Recommender}
For the same reasons than the Collaborative Workspace component, the Ontology
Recommender component is getting raw files from \learnpad Core.  Therefore, the
Recommender component is getting these files, sending them to the XSL-T
Transformations component which return back ontologies of the models.

\subsubsection{Recommender}
The Recommender component is using an ontology to organize the information of
the models.  The ontology is expressed as a RDF format.  This component will be
able to make recommendations to a Civil Servants as he browses a model or play a
simulation.  Contextual information will be used to get the best possible
recommendations, for example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Who is the current Civil Servant?
	\item What the Civil Servant is currently looking at?
	\item In case of simulation, what are the data already entered by the Civil
		Servant?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{XSL-T Transformations}
This component is transforming models into ontologies.  The technology used is
XML specific, and very efficient at parsing XML files to transform them into
other serialization, RDF ontologies in this case.

\subsection{Simulation Environment}
The Simulation Environment component is using Activiti Engine to play
simulations of Business Processes.  Activiti Engine is using BPMN 2.0 format
which was sent by the Modeling Environment component and stored in the \learnpad
Core.

The Simulation Environment component is also generating Graphical User Interface
for the Civil Servant.  However, this GUI are embedded inside the Wiki for 2
reasons:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reduce the number of entry points for the Civil Servants
	\item Display recommendations during the simulation (UI for recommendation
		already exists in the Wiki)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Verification}
The Model Verification component is in charge of verifying consistency of
models.  It runs multiple tests on models in order to identify different kind of
errors.  The Modeling Environment component is able to ask \learnpad Core
component for errors and report them to the modelers.

\subsection{Content Analysis}
The Content Analysis component runs semantic analysis on free text
collaboratively created by Civil Servants in the Wiki component.  It returns
annotations on the text with the following information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start and End of the piece of concerned text
	\item The type of error (among a list of categories)
\end{itemize}

The annotations are then displayed in the Wiki component, providing a workflow
to a Civil Servant for a throrough review of each of these.
